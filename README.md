coursera - getting and cleaning data project

run_analysis has 1 script run_analysis(), which takes no arguments. unzip
data in the working directory.

script opens necessary txt files, merges them together and adds descriptive
names for columns. then creates a smaller tidy dataset with only mean and
 standard deviation entries.
It processes data one more time and creates a smaller tidy data set showing the
average results for each subject and activity. This data table is then written
to a file named "ans.txt" in the working direcotry
